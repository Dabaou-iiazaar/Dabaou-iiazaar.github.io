<h1>Debate Team 19-20</h1>
<h3>Feast your eyes on the formal debate team of Vincent Massey Secondary School, 
Massey Debate! With more than 10 years of students willing to put their spontaneous 
communication skills to the test every week, we have transformed students from being
shy and quiet to being able to talk out of situations that seemed impossible to escape.</h3>
