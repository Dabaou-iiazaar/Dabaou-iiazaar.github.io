<h1>Applications???</h1>
<p>Interested in joining the Massey Debate Club? Keep scrolling to learn more about deadlines.</p>
<p>Semester 1 applications are now CLOSED. However, the 2nd semester (starting around February) applications are open for grabs! Be aware, 
    the number of people who get in are a lot less because the majority of people who get accepted in the first semester are still in the club.
    But hey, why not try out if you can!
</p> 
<p>Are you already accepted as a member, and would like to teach lessons to the club before the debates start? Click the following link to apply
    for it! Be aware, if you have not applied or not been accepted, your application will be deleted.
